Okay, here are your options, as I see it.

#SAY.IrisFlowchart.35.Dr. Acute
We've got this very dramatic shape here, then this slightly less dramatic one.

#SAY.IrisFlowchart.36.Dr. Acute
We also have this very practical but still pretty option. What do you think?

#SAY.IrisFlowchart.30.Iris
I'd like the MOST dramatic shape you can create! Go big or go home, right?!

#SAY.IrisFlowchart.32.Dr. Acute
Well, we have a few options. Here's this moderately dramatic shape, you see, and then there's this one.

#SAY.IrisFlowchart.37.Dr. Acute
It's not quite as bold a shift but I think you'll find it's very becoming.

#SAY.IrisFlowchart.38.Dr. Acute
And of course you can change your mind at any point before we start.

#SAY.IrisFlowchart.33.Iris
No, there's no going back. Is that really all you've got? I was hoping for something a {b}bit{/b} more impressive...

This could be a great opportunity to reconsider your triangle. We could give you a whole new face with one dramatic shift!

#SAY.OwenFlowchart.36.Dr. Acute
Of course we can just recenter it on your face if you'd like, but if you're going for surgery anyway, why not go for broke?

Well, we have a few options. We can just shift it back to the center, but we can also do a bit more work while we're at it, if you're interested.

#SAY.OwenFlowchart.38.Dr. Acute
It's really not so terrible as is, either, so you let me know if you reconsider.

#SAY.OwenFlowchart.33.Owen
It just doesn't look like my face right now. I'm not happy with it, but I'm not interested in really changing it.

Hmmm, not bad, though it's not {i}quite{/i} what I had in mind...

#SAY.OwenFlowchart.97.Dr. Acute
I think a completely fresh new triangle would do wonders for your face! It would be a big boost to your image.
